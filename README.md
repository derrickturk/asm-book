# x86 assembly workspace

I'm slowly working through the book Programming from the Ground Up, by Jonathan Bartlett.
It's pretty good, and apparently free now, which makes sense as I picked it up in high school, bounced off it with my couple of semesters of "C++ knowledge", and put it on a shelf.

Anyway, it's much easier going now.
The code here doesn't match 1:1 with chapter exercises or examples, but I'm trying to roughly follow along with some excursions along the way.
